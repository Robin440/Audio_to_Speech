# Project: Audio Transcription & Speaker Identification

This project transcribes an audio file using OpenAI's Whisper model and formats the transcription by identifying different speakers in the conversation.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required packages. You also need to set up OpenAI's API key to transcribe and identify speakers.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Robin440/Audio_to_Speech.git
    ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. To create and activate a virtual environment:
    -  **For Linux/Mac:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    -  **Windows**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
    Install the required dependencies listed in ```requirements.txt```:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Set OpenAI API Key**
    You need to provide your OpenAI API key in the script to use the Whisper and GPT models. Replace 'your-api-key' with your actual key in the gemini.py file:

    ```python
    openai.api_key = "your-api-key"
    ```
5. **Add Audio File**

    Place the audio file you want to transcribe in the root directory of the project. The audio file must be in ``.mp3`` or other supported formats. For example:
    ```
    
        ├── gemini.py
        ├── requirements.txt
        └── 66db51b15a3029a0fc9bc5b6-REC-2844.mp3
    ```

6. **Run the Script**

    Once everything is set up, run the ``gemini.py`` script:
    ```python
    python gemini.py
    ```
    The script will:
        **Transcribe the audio file using OpenAI Whisper.**
        **Identify speakers and format the conversation accordingly.**

## Requirements
    The necessary Python libraries are listed in the ```requirements.txt``` file They include:
    ```
    openai
    ```
    Make sure to install the dependencies with the command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Notes
    **Ensure you have an active internet connection when running the script as it connects to OpenAI’s API**
    **The transcription and speaker identification process is dependent on the quality of the audio and clarity of the speakers**
