      "Raw response: So, I've been having intermittent abdominal pain, kind of sharp, started right here, started on Easter after I had been gardening, you know, and I can't squat down because I tend to have orthostatic hypotension, so I've been sitting on a, you know, little kid's chair, like this, and I've had this pain before, and it's gone away, and this time it's not going away. It's intermittent. I have felt the side pain over here, this pain, like I said, comes and goes. I've felt it here, so I wasn't sure if it was pancreas or not. I felt different when I had pancreatitis, so I wasn't sure. I'm eating, I'm drinking, I'm farting, I'm pooping. Everything's working right. Any nausea? No. Just the pain? I have, like, sometimes after I eat, I feel suddenly, like, bloated, like, by the end of the day, after eating all day, like, evening time is worse. Like, I need to eat early, like at five o'clock, because I feel like I'm still full and digesting and eating at midnight. Okay. So, what happened on Friday is this intermittent pain, like I said, it's come and go, and I'm not eating as much. Like I said, I don't know, but anyway, I have felt bloated. I feel like it's pushing up here at times. Last week, I take fiber stuff every day, not a lot, but some over-the-early stuff, and same thing, I do the pre-probiotic stuff, too, so I can say my stool is, I mean, I'm in one of these that I can be constipated and crack my penis in the same day, even though I'm that age. I'm that age. Oh, lovely. Well, I'm that age, too. How many babies do you have? There you go. There you go. I attribute some of that to the gut situation. So, like I said, I'm not sure. It's just weird, but then on Friday, I started having an ache in the chest, but it was moving around, but it almost felt like if I was impaled here, I could feel the tip of it here, here, here. You still have your gallbladder? No. Okay. Did they do any testing in the ER? They did a CAT scan with IV contrast, and so, of course, I'm not having a heart attack. I don't have an aortic dissection. I'm not having an emergency, but there's still stuff going on. Yeah, right. No, obviously. But my D-dimer was, like, 1,500 or something weird, and so that's why I'm like... Can I get me high for a million? Lay back for me, please. Straighten your legs out. So, oddly enough, I was thinking about it, and in the past, I have straight for BM, and it felt like I pulled a muscle here. A little tender, but no. A little tender. A little tender. Yeah, so last week, like I said, I had felt more bulge a week before, so I generally, every week, was a little more aggressive, taking Senna, my normal fiber stuff, taking Senna, taking Miralax. You know... That's what the x-ray was. So, here's... I just am not buying that. That is the only thing. But why? And why does, like, sometimes my stool come out like this? Is that because I'm constipated? Should I get something to stuff in here? Can I have scar tissue from the abdominal surgery I had 20 years ago? What was your last poem? I... It's in here, because when I was at my mammogram, she saw the report from Princeton, and she said the recall date was 25. So, I don't remember if it was 2020 or 21 after my apropriatitis. So, but looking at the images, the cell film from the CT scan, I can see solid stool all the way through your entire colon. And so, you can... Hard to say. Sometimes it just happens when we get older. But when you mentioned taking fiber and Senna, how much water do you drink? I... You know, my girls, I just switched departments. I ate... Part in gift was a 32-ounce container that... Drink your water, refill me. I drink two of those a day. Plus, my other normal... I drink those at work. So, I'm drinking water, coffee, you know, with my pills in the morning. I'm a good water drinker. Yeah, yeah. No, I get it. What I was going to say is why don't we do this? Why don't we... Let me give you some instructions to do like a bowel prep, like you're doing colonoscopy. I know. Okay. Well, this is part of the problem, is like taking the Senna, and it's just stupid Senna. I mean, it's not a big deal. It's just... I like have so many cramps and have a blowout that it's like, I'm walking into the toilet. That could be the problem. It's really... What's happening is the liquid stops moving around the solid stuff. And these little acids. I was just going to say, it's... I just need to find something that is... So, what I'm going to recommend, what I usually do is I do this bowel prep, basically like... I've done it before. And then Miralax, and then do the Miralax once a day. And maybe my system just doesn't like my stuff. Yeah, yeah. It doesn't work for everybody. I've been taking the orange powder, whatever, Citrusil, Metamucil, whatever that stuff is. Yeah. Been doing that for, like you say, years and whatever. Yeah, it might not be working for you. It's just weird. But I'm tired. Tired from all the shenanigans. Everything else that I looked at on... A long, long time ago, with good reason. It was attached to an A1C. Well, it sounds like we need an A1C in a little while. Can we do that today? Yeah. While you're here? Yeah. And then let's do this. And then, is Dr. Dorn still with us? He is! That's why he made it. Because I hear doctors all the time. That's... I went to GI. Okay, good. But that's my new department. All right. So, do you want to make an appointment with him and follow up? Yeah. I think that's a problem. We might have some other recommendations. Because, like I said, the pencil stool has happened before in the past. And that's the thing. There's nothing that's consistent. Nothing is consistent. Inconsistently consistent. Yes. Consistently inconsistent. It's repetitive. Like I said, this just isn't... It just keeps moving around. Let's see what he says, okay? But in the meantime, let's do that. Do the bowel prep and start on the Miralax. And then... Yeah. There's something going on there. I think it's bowel-related, colon-related. And whether or not it has anything to do with your prior surgeries or just this chronic constipation. So, okay. So, here's this thing. And this may be, you know, something in the background. So, I have an undiagnosed neurological problem. I have seen what's his matter. And it had the spinal tap and whatever. He said, I think you have CIDP. But we got positive, but we don't have enough to diagnose. And so, that's been several years ago. And so, and I have had... I haven't noticed it lately, but I've had where, like, my stomach just eats. And by the end of the day, I have to puke because my food is not passing through. Yeah, that could be part of it, too. It could be chronic, like, idiopathic gastroparesis. Yeah. So, that's why I wanted to take a look and see what's going on. And I don't remember on the report, if I did it in 21, what was there that you told me to come back for three, four years? Back up again here. Because I can't see that from my portal because I tried snooping around the portal trying to look with... because I don't remember. And who knows where I would have the report. Usually, the da-da-da-da is like the last three paragraphs at the bottom. So, that was saying why I should come back. See, I don't even remember. I don't recall. Yeah, 2025. Okay, yeah. So, it was the year that I had my pancreatitis. I know it's like, welcome to the 50 club, which is now the 45 club. Yeah. So, the real word is, he's good for a year. Okay. The real word. One-year contract. Okay. One by one. Because one of the anesthesiologists asked him the other day, and he said, well, I signed a one-year contract. So, I don't know if that goes, because he came back in October, because that's when I switched. That's the only reason I switched department, is because he came back. And so, yeah, I don't want to go anywhere else. Oh, my God. No weekends. No holidays. No alcohol. Crap. I'm over that. So, yeah, he signed a year contract. And the real word is, unless they piss me off. But, I mean, I think they sweetened the pot enough. It's like, I don't know. I don't think he has to work much in the office, but he just procedures three days a week, and there's 10 to 12 people. And, you know, so half of those are doubles. They don't want to do it. Oh, no. Way too much. That's awesome. Well, good for him. Say hi to everybody. I will. All right. All right. Yeah. All right. A1C and lipids. Yep. And then, we're going to do that. And then, do you need me to make a referral? Just do it. I don't know what the insurance is up to. Whatever. Just, I mean, we'll make it official. And then, my side question is, so, Todd goes for his PET scan in a couple of weeks. So, the weather's nice. He's trying to get up, move around, because he wants to go back to work. You know, by the end of next month, he wants to be back to work. But something's happening. And I don't know. I don't know. When he leaves over, I don't know if the tube, he's still got the tube that's not out yet. Could he be pinching something? Or, because he's lost over 40, 50 pounds, does his blood pressure need to be tweaked? Probably. Probably. Because that's, and that's what I was wondering. Because, you know, just that simple little bending over, picking something, and then he's like. Right. You know. Yeah. Do you want to, can you check orthostatic on it? Well, if he'll let me, that's the problem, is I'm a wife. Yeah, no, I get it. No, just have him make an appointment. I'll talk to him. I don't, but. Yeah, it's probably what is going on. And he's purposely, now, because he can eat anything, but the taste buds and the appetite and all that is still not, his old normal, he's got a new normal, he wants to be 200 pounds. Right. Which, yes, in the long run, that's better, but it's like you're still healing. Yeah. So, the other day, he said he weighed 230-something, so he's lost like 60 pounds. Different person. Yeah, I bet. Now he's drinking beer, so you got to be careful. Right. Extra calories. He must be feeling better, though. He is. Yeah, that's the thing. Like I say, I think it's just that, that woozy thing that comes every now and then, and it seems to be when he's been. Yeah, have him make an appointment, okay, if you will. Labs. Yeah, wait here. She'll come get you, okay? Perfect. All right, see you, Crystal. Thank you. Take care. Our follow-up, she's seen for abdominal pain, physical again. She's got a vapor active bowel sound, abdominal fullness, especially in the back of the quadrants. Review of the CT scan in the ER. Scalp film showed constipation. We're going to give her bowel prep instructions and have her start on Miralax daily. We're going to make a referral to Dr. Doran and Prince and repeat colonoscopy. We're going to check lipids and A1C today and she'll follow up as needed.\n",

Last week, I take fiber stuff every day, not a lot, but some over-the-early stuff, and same thing, I do the pre-probiotic stuff, too, so I can say my stool is, I mean, I'm in one of these that I can be constipated and crack my penis in the same day, even though I'm that age. I'm that age. Oh, lovely. Well, I'm that age, too. How many babies do you have? There you go. There you go. I attribute some of that to the gut situation. So, like I said, I'm not sure. It's just weird, but then on Friday, I started having an ache in the chest, but it was moving around, but it almost felt like if I was impaled here, I could feel the tip of it here, here, here. You still have your gallbladder? No. Okay. Did they do any testing in the ER? They did a CAT scan with IV contrast, and so, of course, I'm not having a heart attack. I don't have an aortic dissection. I'm not having an emergency, but there's still stuff going on. Yeah, right. No, obviously. But my D-dimer was, like, 1,500 or something weird, and so that's why I'm like... Can I get me high for a million? Lay back for me, please. Straighten your legs out. So, oddly enough, I was thinking about it, and in the past, I have straight for BM, and it felt like I pulled a muscle here. A little tender, but no. A little tender. A little tender. Yeah, so last week, like I said, I had felt more bulge a week before, so I generally, every week, was a little more aggressive, taking Senna, my normal fiber stuff, taking Senna, taking Miralax. You know... That's what the x-ray was. So, here's... I just am not buying that. That is the only thing. But why? And why does, like, sometimes my stool come out like this? Is that because I'm constipated? Should I get something to stuff in here? Can I have scar tissue from the abdominal surgery I had 20 years ago? What was your last poem? I... It's in here, because when I was at my mammogram, she saw the report from Princeton, and she said the recall date was 25. So, I don't remember if it was 2020 or 21 after my apropriatitis. So, but looking at the images, the cell film from the CT scan, I can see solid stool all the way through your entire colon. And so, you can... Hard to say. Sometimes it just happens when we get older. But when you mentioned taking fiber and Senna, how much water do you drink? I... You know, my girls, I just switched departments. I ate... Part in gift was a 32-ounce container that... Drink your water, refill me. I drink two of those a day. Plus, my other normal... I drink those at work. So, I'm drinking water, coffee, you know, with my pills in the morning. I'm a good water drinker. Yeah, yeah. No, I get it. What I was going to say is why don't we do this? Why don't we... Let me give you some instructions to do like a bowel prep, like you're doing colonoscopy. I know. Okay. Well, this is part of the problem, is like taking the Senna, and it's just stupid Senna. I mean, it's not a big deal. It's just... I like have so many cramps and have a blowout that it's like, I'm walking into the toilet. That could be the problem. It's really... What's happening is the liquid stops moving around the solid stuff. And these little acids. I was just going to say, it's... I just need to find something that is... So, what I'm going to recommend, what I usually do is I do this bowel prep, basically like... I've done it before. And then Miralax, and then do the Miralax once a day. And maybe my system just doesn't like my stuff. Yeah, yeah. It doesn't work for everybody. I've been taking the orange powder, whatever, Citrusil, Metamucil, whatever that stuff is. Yeah. Been doing that for, like you say, years and whatever. Yeah, it might not be working for you. It's just weird. But I'm tired. Tired from all the shenanigans. Everything else that I looked at on... A long, long time ago, with good reason. It was attached to an A1C. Well, it sounds like we need an A1C in a little while. Can we do that today? Yeah. While you're here? Yeah. And then let's do this. And then, is Dr. Dorn still with us? He is! That's why he made it. Because I hear doctors all the time. That's... I went to GI. Okay, good. But that's my new department. All right. So, do you want to make an appointment with him and follow up? Yeah. I think that's a problem. We might have some other recommendations. Because, like I said, the pencil stool has happened before in the past. And that's the thing. There's nothing that's consistent. Nothing is consistent. Inconsistently consistent. Yes. Consistently inconsistent. It's repetitive. Like I said, this just isn't... It just keeps moving around. Let's see what he says, okay? But in the meantime, let's do that. Do the bowel prep and start on the Miralax. And then... Yeah. There's something going on there. I think it's bowel-related, colon-related. And whether or not it has anything to do with your prior surgeries or just this chronic constipation. So, okay. So, here's this thing. And this may be, you know, something in the background. So, I have an undiagnosed neurological problem. I have seen what's his matter. And it had the spinal tap and whatever. He said, I think you have CIDP. But we got positive, but we don't have enough to diagnose. And so, that's been several years ago. And so, and I have had... I haven't noticed it lately, but I've had where, like, my stomach just eats. And by the end of the day, I have to puke because my food is not passing through. Yeah, that could be part of it, too. It could be chronic, like, idiopathic gastroparesis. Yeah. So, that's why I wanted to take a look and see what's going on. And I don't remember on the report, if I did it in 21, what was there that you told me to come back for three, four years? Back up again here. Because I can't see that from my portal because I tried snooping around the portal trying to look with... because I don't remember. And who knows where I would have the report. Usually, the da-da-da-da is like the last three paragraphs at the bottom. So, that was saying why I should come back. See, I don't even remember. I don't recall. Yeah, 2025. Okay, yeah. So, it was the year that I had my pancreatitis. I know it's like, welcome to the 50 club, which is now the 45 club. Yeah. So, the real word is, he's good for a year. Okay. The real word. One-year contract. Okay. One by one. Because one of the anesthesiologists asked him the other day, and he said, well, I signed a one-year contract. So, I don't know if that goes, because he came back in October, because that's when I switched. That's the only reason I switched department, is because he came back. And so, yeah, I don't want to go anywhere else. Oh, my God. No weekends. No holidays. No alcohol. Crap. I'm over that. So, yeah, he signed a year contract. And the real word is, unless they piss me off. But, I mean, I think they sweetened the pot enough. It's like, I don't know. I don't think he has to work much in the office, but he just procedures three days a week, and there's 10 to 12 people. And, you know, so half of those are doubles. They don't want to do it. Oh, no. Way too much. That's awesome. Well, good for him. Say hi to everybody. I will. All right. All right. Yeah. All right. A1C and lipids. Yep. And then, we're going to do that. And then, do you need me to make a referral? Just do it. I don't know what the insurance is up to. Whatever. Just, I mean, we'll make it official. And then, my side question is, so, Todd goes for his PET scan in a couple of weeks. So, the weather's nice. He's trying to get up, move around, because he wants to go back to work. You know, by the end of next month, he wants to be back to work. But something's happening. And I don't know. I don't know. When he leaves over, I don't know if the tube, he's still got the tube that's not out yet. Could he be pinching something? Or, because he's lost over 40, 50 pounds, does his blood pressure need to be tweaked? Probably. Probably. Because that's, and that's what I was wondering. Because, you know, just that simple little bending over, picking something, and then he's like. Right. You know. Yeah. Do you want to, can you check orthostatic on it? Well, if he'll let me, that's the problem, is I'm a wife. Yeah, no, I get it. No, just have him make an appointment. I'll talk to him. I don't, but. Yeah, it's probably what is going on. And he's purposely, now, because he can eat anything, but the taste buds and the appetite and all that is still not, his old normal, he's got a new normal, he wants to be 200 pounds. Right. Which, yes, in the long run, that's better, but it's like you're still healing. Yeah. So, the other day, he said he weighed 230-something, so he's lost like 60 pounds. Different person. Yeah, I bet. Now he's drinking beer, so you got to be careful. Right. Extra calories. He must be feeling better, though. He is. Yeah, that's the thing. Like I say, I think it's just that, that woozy thing that comes every now and then, and it seems to be when he's been. Yeah, have him make an appointment, okay, if you will. Labs. Yeah, wait here. She'll come get you, okay? Perfect. All right, see you, Crystal. Thank you. Take care. Our follow-up, she's seen for abdominal pain, physical again. She's got a vapor active bowel sound, abdominal fullness, especially in the back of the quadrants. Review of the CT scan in the ER. Scalp film showed constipation. We're going to give her bowel prep instructions and have her start on Miralax daily. We're going to make a referral to Dr. Doran and Prince and repeat colonoscopy. We're going to check lipids and A1C today and she'll follow up as needed.\n",

      "Speaker 1: So, I've been having intermittent abdominal pain, kind of sharp, started right here, started on Easter after I had been gardening, you know, and I can't squat down because I tend to have orthostatic hypotension, so I've been sitting on a, you know, little kid's chair, like this, and I've had this pain before, and it's gone away, and this time it's not going away. It's intermittent. I have felt the side pain over here, this pain, like I said, comes and goes. I've felt it here, so I wasn't sure if it was pancreas or not. I felt different when I had pancreatitis, so I wasn't sure. I'm eating, I'm drinking, I'm farting, I'm pooping. Everything's working right.\n",
